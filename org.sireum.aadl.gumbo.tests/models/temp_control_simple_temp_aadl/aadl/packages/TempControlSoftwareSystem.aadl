--       SimpleTemp - illustrate a temperature data type with only degrees (not unit) as a field
--       Mixed - with mixed port catagories (event, data, event data)
--       UI - with a simple UI for an operator interface   
--
--       Platform - Slang/JVM -- this example is designed for the HAMR Slang/JVM platform.  
--         Other versions of this example illustrate Linux and seL4 platforms.
--
--       The package structure reflects a conceptual business ecosystem in which stakeholders exchange AADL
--       modeling elements to manage distributed development:
--         - temperature sensor and cooling fan components are acquired from suppliers other than the 
--            system integrator (thus, these components are located in separate packages delivered by those suppliers).
--         - the system integrator designs the temperature controller and operator interface for the system
--            (thus, those components are in this package) and integrates all components into a system.

        -- For simplicity in this introductory example, a single process is used.
        -- On the Slang/JVM platform, process architecture does not affect code generation.
        -- However, for Linux and seL4 platforms, there are constraints on the structure 
        -- of processes and their contents because processes reflect separate memory address
        -- spaces, which are reflected in code generation, e.g., as distinct seL4 partitions (CAmkES components).
        -- The broader concept here is that the notion of AADL process is used by HAMR to 
        -- model partitioning/isolation of software elements.
